# CleaningPipeRobot
College project about building a robot capable of cleaning a pipe, removing metal junk.

There are two different files. States.png is an image containing the states of the FSM project, and table.png contains the robot's path on a specific map. This marks just the first step of the project, so it's expected to utilize software to enhance the appearance of the states.
